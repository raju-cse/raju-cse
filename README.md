# 👋 Hi , I'm Raju Ahmad  
👀 I’m interested in Backend Developer & Engineering


## 🚀 About Me

I’m passionate about solving **real-world problems** through clean, efficient, and well-structured code.  
My journey began with **competitive programming**, where I honed my skills in algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving efficiency.

- 🧠 Solved **1000+ problems** across popular online judges such as **CSES**, **Codeforces**, **LightOJ**, **CodeChef**, **SPOJ**, **UVA**, and **AtCoder**  
- 🏆 Participated in **50+ Codeforces contests**  
- 💡 Gained strong analytical and optimization skills through consistent problem-solving practice  

Now, I’m channeling that experience into **software development**, building robust and scalable applications using **ASP.NET Core**, **Web APIs**, and **modern development practices**, while also leveraging **Golang** for high-performance backend projects.

## 🧠 Technical Skills  

- 💻 **Programming Languages:** C, C++, Go, Java, Python, C#  
- 🧩 **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Strong understanding of OOP concepts in C++  
- 🌐 **Web Technologies:** HTML, CSS, RESTful API, JWT Authentication  
- ⚙️ **Frameworks & Tools:** ASP.NET Core, MySQL  
- 🏗️ **Architecture:** Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design (DDD)  
- 🧮 **Core CS Concepts:** Data Structures, Algorithms, and Artificial Intelligence (AI)  
- 🧠 **Soft Skills:** Excellent analytical and problem-solving abilities  


## 🌱 I’m currently learning:

- **Docker & Kubernetes** – for containerization and orchestration  
- **Operating Systems (OS)** – to deepen understanding of system-level concepts  
- **Architecture Diagrams** – for designing scalable and maintainable software systems
